      To the love of my life, I just wanna remind you that I fall more in love with you day by day. I love you every second, every minute, every hour, every day, and maybe even every universe. <br><br> Tbh, you were just a random person who came into my life, and Im not a person who trusts someone easily but for you I broke my own rules. Maybe it’s the way you laugh, the way you talk, or just the way you are. <br> Just know that for as long as I breathe, my heart will always love you.
      <br>I LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUCHHHHHH HONEYYYYY💌😘
